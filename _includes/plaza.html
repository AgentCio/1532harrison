				Recognizing that the Western SOMA Task Force and Eastern Neighborhoods Citizen Advisory Committee have identified 12th Street as a “priority greening opportunity,” we are collaborating with StartUP Public Spaces, a local non- profit, our neighbors at the Eagle, and the Planning Department’s Pavement to Parks Program, to transform a 12,710-SF portion of 12th Street near Harrison into a new public plaza and green space. Based on our initial conversations with the community, there seems to be interest in starting with a temporary or “pop-up” plaza first to test the street closure, design and programming ideas. This temporary phase we are calling “Eaglet Plaza.” If there is a positive reception, we will work closely with StartUP Public Spaces, the owners of the Eagle and our neighbors to make the plaza permanent—and see it grow into Eagle Plaza.
