						<p>Build Inc. submitted a <strong>Preliminary Project Assessment (PPA) application</strong> in late October 2013, the very first step in the City’s lengthy entitlement process.</p>
						<p>After receiving a “PPA Response Letter” from the Planning Department in December 2013, we then submitted an <strong>Environmental Evaluation (EE) application</strong> to secure a place in the (long) queue to be assigned a California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) planner by the Planning Department.</p> 
						<p>After a 5 month wait, we were assigned a CEQA planner on May 17; the environmental process has just started.</p>
						<p>We will not submit our <strong>Conditional Use (CU) application</strong> until we’ve had additional meetings with neighborhood stakeholders. To that end we will hold our <strong>kick-off community workshop</strong> in <strong>June 2014</strong> to make sure your voice is heard.</p>
						<p>Based on the estimated June 1 start date for the CEQA process, <strong>we hope to appear before the Planning Commission no later than April 2015.</strong></p>
						<p>During the 10+ months leading up to the Planning Commission hearing, we will host a <strong>series of community workshops</strong> to share ideas and collect your feedback on the project.</p>
						<p>Please participate!   We want this to be a collaborative process, and we need neighborhood input and support.</p>
