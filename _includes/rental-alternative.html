				The proposed residential units would include a mix of studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom residences.  A full underground garage would include, per Planning Code, up to 89 off-street parking spaces and a minimum of 105 bicycle parking spaces.  An approximately 250-gsf bicycle maintenance area would be located at street level, as well as an approximately 2,000 gsf ground floor retail space.
