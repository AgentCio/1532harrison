<h2>The Neighborhood</h2>
<p>
  Western SoMa is a microcosm of the experiences, places and people that make San Francisco an extraordinary city.  Home to one of the most diverse mix of uses and building types you can find in any neighborhood in the City today.  From SROs to Live-Work Lofts, from leather bars to light industrial uses, from high-end restaurants to Costco, West SOMA is a neighborhood of healthy contrast and diversity.

  We embrace, and seek to build upon, the strengths of West SOMA's eclectic urban fabric.  Our design deploys place-making to honor West SOMA's LGBTQ culture and its post-World War II industrial working class roots.

  If approved, "Eagle Plaza" could become one of SOMA's premier public gathering spaces, supporting long-standing neighborhood traditions like the Folsom Street and Up Your Alley festivals, and serving as a quiet and green respite from the congested urban streets on a daily basis.  Our proposed design would also add two new "green alleys" to West SOMA's renowned network of fine-grained alley residential enclaves.
