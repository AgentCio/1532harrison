			<h3>Duygu Gun</h3>
			<div>
				<p>My name is Duygu, my friends call me Du'. I'm born and bred in Turkey; lived in Rome, London and Munich before I landed in San Francisco following my heart. I love meeting people from different life paths because we can only experience one life; so the rest of the story has to be told by someone else. I spend most of my time thinking about how to merge art, tech, and business. When I am not around, you may find me at a Forr√≥ party or at the circus center.I am a serial co-liver, spent only 12% of my life occupying a living space alone. I believe that communities, sharing and co-creating will be the only way we will survive and enjoy the galaxy.</p>

				<p>Coliving has absolutely rocked my world since I got serious about it in 2009. I love decompressing after a long day by having a casual conversation with friends. I love being surprised by some thoughtful treat when I open the door to my fridge. I love knowing that someone will water my plants when I go out of town.  And these are just some of the very real, daily benefits of living with folks--the greater social and political implications of creating a culture based on sharing leave me warm and fuzzy inside.</p>

				<p>I love co-living. I currently live at 20Mission, a 40 person co-living place in San Francisco's Mission District. I've made tons of amazing deep friendships here. I can't see myself ever living without community from here on out.</p>
